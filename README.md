- Hi, Iâ€™m @ayushmoharana
- Iâ€™m interested in science of multiple star systems.
- Iâ€™m currently working as a Research Associate in the SWIPE Project (PI: J. Southworth). 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on observations and simulations of eclipsing binaries which are pulsators or are in triple systems.
